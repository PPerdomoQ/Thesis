# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drug Reourposing using Knowledge Graphs and eXplainable AI

In this repository you will find the code necessary to run the pipeline shown in: *TODO: Add paper*. This pipeline is part of a Master Thesis project and it is expected to be improved throughout time. 

The objective of this project is that, given a number of seeds related to a target (rare) disease, several drug candidates and **explanations** will be obtained for the targeted disease. *TODO: Add pipeline*

In total, three Jupyter Notebooks are used to obtain the predictions and the explanations. The first one, *TODO: Add file*, is used to create a Knowledge Graph containing information of the disease. In this first notebook, only information from Monarch *TODO: Add link*, is used. To incorporate drug information (Drug-Target and Drug Disease) the second notebook, *TODO: Add file*. This notebook incorporates information from DrugCentral and Therapeutic Terget Database. The final notebook, *TODO: Add file*, is the one that provides the predictions and the explanations. Each notebook contains information about its use, but in the next sections there is a small summary showing its details.

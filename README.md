# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Drug Reourposing using Knowledge Graphs and eXplainable AI

In this repository you will find the code necessary to run the pipeline shown in: *TODO: Add paper*. This pipeline is part of a Master Thesis project and it is expected to be improved throughout time. 

The objective of this project is that, given a number of seeds related to a target (rare) disease, several drug candidates and **explanations** will be obtained for the targeted disease.

In total, three Jupyter Notebooks will be used to obtain the predictions and the explanations.
